-    GITHUB_TOKEN: Your GitHub personal access token with repo scope.

-   GITHUB_USERNAME: Your GitHub username.

-    GITHUB_REPO: The name of the GitHub repository where images will be stored.

-    GITHUB_BRANCH: The branch to use in the repository (default: main).

-   GITHUB_FOLDER: The folder within the repository to store images (default: images).

## Deployment
To deploy PicLink to a production environment:

### Backend Deployment
1. Deploy the backend to a server (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, DigitalOcean)
2. Set the environment variables in your hosting platform's dashboard
3. Ensure the server is running and accessible via a public URL

### Frontend Deployment
1. Deploy the frontend to a hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
2. Update the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in the frontend's environment variables to point to the deployed backend URL

### CORS Configuration
- Update the `FRONTEND_URL` in the backend's environment variables to the deployed frontend URL

### GitHub Repository
- Ensure the GitHub repository is public, as jsDelivr requires public access to serve the images
